Extra Voting forms - installation
---------------------------

Unpack the module in your "modules" directory.

INSTALLATION:

1. Place the module in the "modules" directory of your drupal installation

2. This module requires jQuery 1.2.1, which is not what comes with Drupal 5.x. 
   Unfortunately, the JQuery Update module won't be very helpful since it
   doesn't come with JQuery 1.2.1. You will need to use the JQuery module
   that comes with this module: jquery-1.2.1.pack.js and copy it over
   [your_drupal_directory]/misc/jquery.js

   This might possibly break other modules - sorry! This is a temporary
   problem: Drupal 6.x, coming out soon, will use JQuery 1.2.1 

3. Enable this module by navigating to:
        Administer > Site building > Modules

4. Go to Administer > User Management > Access control, and set one or more
   users as voting administrators. 

5. Step 5 was deleted because it was no longer necessary. Ah! :-D

6. OPTIONAL. If you want to place the karma form or info anywhere else in the
   comment, open your comment.tpl.php file and add:

   <? if(module_exists('extra_voting_forms')){ print extra_voting_forms_show_form($comment, 'c', 1, 'big');} ?> (to show the form anywhere in the comment, type #1, "big" version. You can also choose "small")

   If you want to place the karma form or info anywhere else in the
   node, open your node.tpl.php:

   <? if(module_exists('extra_voting_forms')){ print extra_voting_forms_show_form($node, 'n', 3, 'big');} ?> (to show the form anywhere in the node)

   The third parameter can be:

     1 -- Select, with all of the possile values available
     2 -- Select, with only the negative values allowed
     3 -- Vote up/down
     4 -- Vote UP ONLY

   Please note that the voting skin "fsdailys" in ICOMPLETE, that is only some
   combinations are allowed (the ones you see in http://www.fsdaily.com). For
   customisation, if you want a complete set please base your template
   on "default".

7. Configure your module by going to 

    Administer > Site configuration > Extra Voting forms

   The options should be self-explanatory.

8. Enjoy!
